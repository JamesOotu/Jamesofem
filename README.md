**INTRODUCTION**

This data provides an overview of COVID-19 statistics across various countries, showing key metrics such as confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, active cases, and weekly trends. The columns include:
Country/Region: The specific location.
Confirmed: Total confirmed cases.
Deaths: Total fatalities due to COVID-19.
Recovered: Individuals who have recovered.
Active: Current active cases.
New Cases/Deaths/Recovered: The number of new cases, deaths, or recoveries reported recently.
Deaths/Recovered per 100 Cases: Percentage metrics indicating death and recovery rates.
Deaths per 100 Recovered: Fatalities relative to recoveries.
Confirmed Last Week: Total cases recorded a week ago.
1 Week Change and % Increase: Weekly case changes and their growth percentage.
WHO Region: World Health Organization regional classification.
This study leverages a comprehensive diabetes dataset to analyze and predict diabetes onset based on various health-related features. 
The dataset includes medical diagnostic measures such as glucose concentration, blood pressure, insulin levels, BMI, and family history of diabetes, among others. 
Using a structured data analysis pipeline, missing values were addressed, features normalized, and key variables engineered to enhance model performance.

**BRIEF DEFINITION OF TERMS**
1.	Diabetes: A chronic health condition characterized by high blood glucose levels due to insufficient insulin production, ineffective insulin utilization, or both.
2.	Glucose Concentration: The amount of sugar present in the blood, measured in mg/dL. Elevated levels are a key indicator of diabetes.
3.	Body Mass Index (BMI): A numerical measure of body fat calculated from an individual's weight and height, often used to categorize underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obesity.
4.	Blood Pressure: The pressure exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels, measured in mmHg. It is a critical health indicator often linked to diabetes complications.
5.	Insulin: A hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates blood glucose levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells.
6.	Family History of Diabetes: A measure indicating whether diabetes has been diagnosed in immediate family members, which is a significant risk factor for the condition.
7.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics using visualizations and statistical techniques.
8.	Machine Learning: A branch of artificial intelligence that enables models to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.
9.	Classification Models: Predictive models used in machine learning to categorize data into predefined classes, such as "diabetic" or "non-diabetic."
10.	Accuracy: A performance metric in machine learning that represents the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total predictions.
11.	Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions, reflecting the accuracy of positive predictions.
12.	Recall (Sensitivity): The ratio of true positive predictions to the actual number of positive instances, indicating the model's ability to identify all relevant cases.
13.	F1-Score: A weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall, used to balance these metrics in imbalanced datasets.
14.	Feature Engineering: The process of creating additional relevant features from raw data to improve model performance.
15.	Predictive Modeling: The use of statistical or machine learning techniques to forecast outcomes based on input features.
